One full rotation of wheel: 90mm * pi = 28.27433cm
Therefore one tick travels: 28.27433cm/2240 = 0.01262246875cm

gertrudes wheel diameter is 90mm
gertrudes motor tick per rotation is 2240
gertrude is 46 cm long
gertrudes front is at the start of a round is 77.2 cm away from the skystones
gertrudes arm is 42.5 cm long
gertrudes front is tba 21 cm from a skyblock when picking it up 
gertrude has to move 56.2 cm at the start of the round to pick up skyblock
gertrudes gap between claws when open is 16 cm long
gertrudes gap between claws when closed is 8 cm long
gertrudes reach is tba
gertrudes turn rate is tba
gertrudes arm movement speed is is tba
